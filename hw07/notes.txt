Shell checklist
+ When started, your program should write a greeting message to user
+ write a prompt symbol and wait for the user to enter a command
+ PROMPTSYMBOL and MORELINESSYMBOL
+ each line that is part of multi-line command (except for the first one) a shell must write MULTILINESYMBOL at the beginning followed by a single whitespace
+ must provide a command symbol that can be used to change these symbols

+ charsets takes no arguments and lists names of supported charsets for your Java platform
+ single charset name is written per line

+ cat takes one or two arguments
+ The first argument is path to some file and is mandatory
+ The second argument is charset name that should be used to interpret chars from bytes
+ If not provided, a default platform charset should be used
+ This command opens given file and writes its content to console

+ ls takes a single argument – directory – and writes a directory listing (not recursive)
+ Output should be formatted as in following example

+ tree command expects a single argument: directory name and prints a tree
+ each directory level shifts output two charatcers to the right

+ copy command expects two arguments: source file name and destination file name (i.e. paths and names)
+ if destination file exists, ask user if allowed to overwrite
+ copy command must work only with files (no directories)
- if the second argument is directory, you should assume that user wants to copy the original file into that directory using the original file name
+  must implement copying yourself: you are not allowed to simply call copy methods from Files class

+ mkdir command takes a single argument: directory name, and creates the appropriate directory structure
 
+ the hexdump command expects a single argument: file name, and produces hex-output as illustrated

+ command where a file-path is expected, you must support quotes to allow paths with spaces (such as "Documents and Settings").

+ If user provides invalid or wrong argument for any of commands, appropriate message should be written and your shell should be prepared to accept a new command from user

+ Shell terminates when user gives exit command
