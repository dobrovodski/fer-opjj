To start if off, an easy one:
{$ FOR i -1 10 1 $} {$END$}

You want a number? Here's a string instead.
{$ FOR i"-1" 10 1 $} {$END$}

Wow, i love this language.
{$ FOR i "-1"10 1 $} {$END$}

Seriously?
{$ FOR i"1""10""1"$} {$END$}

Looks unreadable to me.
{$=@decfmt"hellothere"123"10"$}

Are you sure about this? \\
\{$=-10"20"534$}

It has to work, right?
{$ = "this" "is" "hell" "\"\"" "\\\\"$}
