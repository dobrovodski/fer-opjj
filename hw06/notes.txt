ValueWrapper
- values can be any object
- if you do arithmetic operations, that rule no longer applies
- both this.value and other value have to be either: null, String, Integer, Double
    - if null then convert to Integer with value of 0
    - if String then convert to either Double or Integer
    ^ these two handled by Number#convert
    - if either are Double, both should be Double and result is Double
    - if both are Integer, both should be Integer and result is Integer
- for numCompare
    - if both null, they are equal (return 0)
    - if one is null, treat it as Integer 0
    - otherwise promote both values to the same type like above and do comparison
